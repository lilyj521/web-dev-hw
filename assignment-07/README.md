1. Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.
    ID's are like names for your elements. Each one gets its own specific name that identifies it. Similar elements can then be categorized into groups, called classes. So two blue shapes might be named blue-circle and blue-square, but both could belong to the class of blue-shape. Divs are significant to the structure of the page, and put elements into sections for better readability and structural clarity. Spans put content together that requires extra styles, such as unique text.
2. What is "alt text," and why do we use it?
    Alt text is text that describes an image or video, to accomodate those who are visually impaired and/or use screen readers.
3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
    For this assignment, I began with reading the topic for this week on the website. Then I began following along with the steps to complete the assignment. I created a rough outline for myself, and then I chose my song. I then went back through and added in all the specific content from the song. Then I uploaded my assigment to Github.
