    <h2> Song Lyrics </h2>
      <p>
        You wake up late you feel your heart begin to work </br>
        and now you’re all dressed up of course </br>
        and hailing cabs out of your door </br>
      </p>
      <p>
        on 14th street I feel my head between my knees </br>
        and orange swimming through the trees </br>
        and orange swimming through the trees </br>
      </p>
      <p>
        where could I go what could I do put in the state </br>
        my lips and eyes give me away </br>
        and now there’s nothing I can say no </br>
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m pulled away I see another of myself </br>
        who’s found true love and happiness </br>
        to sit and smoke there on the chair for </br>
      </p>
      <p>
        two boys: one to kiss your neck and one to bring you breakfast, get you out of bed when </br>
        you’re sore from the night before from knocking at my door your head against the floor boards </br>
        two boys: one to love you sweetly one does so discreetly never will he meet me but </br>
        I’m sure that you'll catch your breath you’ll sleep into the day to wake up with sunlight across your room </br>
      </p>
      <p>
        before I leave I want to try to go back in time </br>
        to just that moment in my life where I should have spoke up but I lied </br>
      </p>
      <p>
        as I sat there with my jaw open and I smiled </br>
        he pulled his sweater off and tried to explain he’d all but given up on love </br>
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m pulled away I see another of myself who’s found true love and happiness </br>
        To sit and joke there on the chair </br>
      </p>
      <p>
        beside the bed I read this past week’s New Yorker </br>
        and I watch him paint Antarctica and watch him paint Antarctica </br>
      </p>
      <p>
        two boys: one to kiss your neck and one to bring you breakfast, get you out of bed when </br>
        you’re sore from the night before from knocking on my door your head against the floor boards </br>
        two boys one to love you sweetly one does so discreetly never will he meet me </br>
        but I'm sure that you'll catch your breath you’ll sleep into the day to wake up with sunlight across your room </br>
      </p>
      <p>
        telling me something or nothing </br>
        never the one thing I wanna hear </br>
        telling me something or nothing </br>
        never the one thing I wanna hear </br>
