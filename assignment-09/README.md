1. Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?
Universal selectors edit everything in the page, class selectors edit specific classes, such as paragraphs or headings, id selectors only edit elements with the specified id. If you want one paragraph to look one way, but the next to look different, you may use an id selector rather than a class selector. If you want different backgrounds for different parts of your page, you may edit the background with a class selector rather than a universal selector.

2. Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes.
I chose 3 vibrant pastel colors for my 80s theme. Their rgb values are rgb(133, 233, 188), rgb(219, 169, 200), and rgb(96, 138, 209).

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
For this assignment, I spent some time looking at different design trends over the decades, before settling on the 80s, as I enjoyed the use of extreme colors and patterns. Then I followed through the assignment walkthrough, while checking the website occasionally for help.
