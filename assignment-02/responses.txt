### 1. Briefly describe one way data travels on the internet.
One way data travels through the internet is through fiber optic cables, as light. Using light, we can send multiple bits simultaneously, at the speed of light. The downside of fiber optic cables is that they can be expensive, and sometimes unreliable, e.g. the 2008 submarine cable disruption.
### 2. What is the relationship between an IP address and the DNS?
