How is the web different than the internet? The internet is a bunch of networks all connected together: a network of networks. The web is information that is connected together, that can be accessed using the internet.
Briefly describe how the internet works. The internet works by connecting clients, through ISPs, to servers. Both ISPs and Servers are connected directly to the internet, while clients are connected through ISPs. Information sent between clients and servers are broken into packets. When packets get to their destination computer, they're reassembled into the original info. Computers know where to send the info because of IP addresses. Any information sent through the internet goes through multiple routers on its way. These routers (as well as ISPs and servers) attach their IP address to the info, like a trail of bread crumbs that can be followed back to the original computer. 
What is a directory, and what is its relationship to files? A directory is the same concept as a folder; it holds related files and "folders" inside of it. The relationship between directories and files is that files are nested inside directories, which may be nested inside other directories, which are all nested in the root directory.
Why is using a VCS beneficial? A VCS tracks changes made in a file, so if you make a mistake, you can revert to a previous version of the file and quickly undo it. It's similar to using command+z in photoshop. A VCS also makes collaborative work easier, as everyone can see and manage all the changes made to the file.
