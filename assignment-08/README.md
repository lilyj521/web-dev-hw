1. Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?
The most interesting parts of this assignment were styling the page and linking pages together into a cohesive website. I learned to use HEX colors in my pages, which was very useful. I had a bit of a difficult time with aligning elements to get them where I want them to go.

2. Next module we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?
I'm most excited to have more freedom and creativity over the design of my pages. I am anxious that I will get caught up in the design of pages and forget about the function.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
This work cycle, I began by looking through the assignment requirements and the module on the website. I then followed along with the walkthrough, and created a template for myself. I then decided on my topic for the webpage and filled in the blanks.
