1. Did you learn anything new about web development (ie using GitHub, version control, repositories)?
I learned about using GitHub Desktop to upload to Github. It made things a lot faster than trying to upload my code manually. It also made it so that I could upload a first draft, and then tweak the code and upload it once it was fixed.

2. Did you learn anything new about web design (ie using media, color, fonts)?
I learned a lot about html coding, and about effectively combining colors. I also learned about choosing colors that complement the images in my web design.  

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
For this assignment, I went through past assignments to pick out inspiration. I also looked at previous website designs I've done in other classes and on my own personal website. Then, I went through each page and individually designed them. I also went back through the class website when I got stuck.
